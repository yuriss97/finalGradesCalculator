# finalGradesCalculator

This VBA macro is designed to calculate the final grades for students based on their individual grades and determine if they meet the approval criteria. It contains some VBA fundamentals and operates on "Sheet1". It calculates each student's final grade and places it into the 'final grades' column. If the student is approved, it also changes the color of the final grade column to either green or red.
